    <li><strong>Marketing Restrictions:</strong> Limitations on advertising and promotion can make it harder for vape shops to attract new customers and build brand awareness.</li>
    <li><strong>Online Sales Restrictions:</strong> Regulations surrounding <strong>online vape store</strong> operations can limit reach and create complexities for businesses aiming for a broader customer base.</li>

<h3>Online vs. Brick-and-Mortar: The Omni-Channel Vape Business</h3>

    <li><strong>Building a Strong Online Presence:</strong> Even with a brick-and-mortar store, having a website, social media presence, and potentially offering online ordering for local pickup can expand reach and convenience.</li>
    <li><strong>Adapting to Regulatory Changes:</strong> Proactively monitoring and adapting to evolving regulations, while advocating for reasonable policies, is crucial for long-term viability.</li>
    <li><strong>Exploring Emerging Nicotine Products:</strong> Staying abreast of new developments in the broader <strong>nicotine products market</strong>, such as nicotine pouches or heat-not-burn devices, can offer diversification opportunities.</li>
</ul>
